I have some expectations for this class. Firstly, I expect this class to be challenging because of the scope of the class. From what i've been hearing this class has been really hard with a high mortality rate. Secondly, I expect everyone in this class to be professional but accomodating. Thank you!

I agree with your expectations.
Your expectation of this class being challenging matches the story shared by our classmates during the self-introduction on our first class.
I am hoping that everyone in our class will be accomodating and professional too.
Good expectations overall.
